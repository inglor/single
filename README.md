Single
======

Traditional Operative Systems have several sources of input: keyboard, mouse, track pad, video camera, microphone etc.

Such a massive amount of different inputs is used to perform several actions from the OS. However, there are some
people that, for several health reasons, could not easily control such input devices.

We decided to go design an application that could handle the bare minimum input information. Single is going to be
designed to respond to a single boolean input per time.

The idea is to construct a flexible framework that could host several application, the initial idea is to introduce a
set of application to improve the life quality of the users:
 1) Write, will allowed the user to compose texts using a single input.
 2) Play some musics
 3) Play a movie
 4) Browser internet

In future step will be to integrate the application with the most famous social media.
